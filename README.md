Illustrating BASIC
==================

*[Illustrating BASIC](https://archive.org/details/ibaspl/mode/2up))* is a 1977 primer for the BASIC programming language by Donald Alcock. It is one of the few that is written using [Dartmouth BASIC Version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_BASIC) - most texts that are written for Dartmouth use only the instructions from the earlier versions, and thus lack some of the more interesting features that were added in V4, like matrix math and `PRINT USING`.

In the original book, programs are presented in a somewhat haphazard way, in snippets intended to illustrate one feature or another. All of the source code was hand-written, not typed, which results in odd spacing and other inconsistances between the examples. These have been translated into as common a format as possible. The only changes were to add a `REM` if one did not appear in the original text, generally using line number 5, and adding the page number to that remark to make it easier to look up.
